## What's this?

UwU glad you asked. This repository contains all assets for our game _Shadow Parkour_, submitted as our final project for UMD CMSC425 Game Programming. In this game, you jump around on blocks and try to avoid the guards. There are numerous collectibles per level (only one level as of now, with 3 collectibles). Your goal is to collect each one as fast as possible. There are light and dark zones. You travel fast in the dark zones, but slow in the light zones. Dark zones are harder to traverse, though.

## What's here?

Assets and project files. Most of our assest were hand-created, although some (like character models and animation) were pulled from external sources.

not sure what else we wanna add tbh
